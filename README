General
=======

This is a module for [ITK](http://itk.org): The Insight Toolkit for Segmentation and
Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4
modular system and  to be places it ITK/Modules/External or uses as a
Remote module.


Getting Started
===============

The official ITKv4 Wiki documentation on adding an external module is here:

Thin Shell Demons External Module
=================================

Thin Shell Demons External Module is a mesh-to-mesh registration external module. 
Reference: "Thin Shell Demons: Zhao Q, Price T, Pizer S, Niethammer M, Alterovitz R, Rosenman J, MIUA 2015

Following the standard ITK registration workflow, this module has the followings components (files)
1. Transformation (itkMeshDisplacementTransform)
	MeshDisplacementTransformation defines a finite dimensional vector space defined on mesh vertices (e.g. space coordinates). The parameter m_VectorField is a 1D array in the form of [x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,...], where the subscript is the index of a vertex. A mesh has to be associated with the transformation to serve as the template. The template essentially defines the number of vertices, so that m_VectorField can be initialized and allocated with a correct size.

2. Metric (itkMeshToMeshMetric -> itkThinShellDemonsMetric)
	MeshToMeshMetric: This class is templated over the type of the two point-sets. This class serves as the base for all kinds of mesh-to-mesh metrics (in some sense computing the similarity between two meshes). It expects a mesh-to-mesh transformation to be plugged in. This class computes a value (also with derivative) that measures a registration metric between the fixed mesh and the moving mesh.
	ThinShellDemonsMetric: This Class inherits the base MeshToMeshMetric. It expects a mesh-to-mesh transformaton to be plugged in. This class computes a metric value, which is a combination of geometric feature matching quality and the Thin Shell deformation Energy. This metric computation part (objective function) is the core of the Thin Shell Demons algorithm. When initializing a metric object of this class with two meshes, the metric object first pre-computes geometric feature matching between the two meshes. The matching results stay the same during the optimization process.

3. Optimizer
	Different thin shell energy approximation leads to different objective function formulations, thereby requiring different optimizers. The current objective function adopts a quadratic form. Therefore, Conjugate Gradient is a preferable optimizer.

4. Registration Method (itkMeshToMeshRegistrationMethod)
	This class is templated over pointset-to-pointset registration method. Users will create an object of this class to perform Thin Shell Demons. See the test example for usage.
